# In over my head: How I built a full stack web app with no prior experience

This summer, I built my first full stack web app: a collaborative music listening platform called [Duotonic](https://duotonic.co). Before starting the project, I had never touched React or Node.js, and I only had a basic understanding of Javascript. The summer was full of twists and turns, but in the end I'm proud to say I can call the project more or less complete, even if it is not the best piece of software ever written. Better yet, I can walk away from the project knowing I've gained an incredible amount of experience that I'll be able to apply in the future to more thoughtfully planned web projects.

## The Idea

In the spring, a friend and I decided we wanted to put our programming skills together and work on a project together -- one that would presumably be on the web, though neither of us had much experience in the area.

At that time -- the height of the pandemic in my corner of the world -- the Chrome extension Netflix Party was rapidly gaining popularity among young people who wanted to socialize but were stuck at home. The idea was simple, we would create Netflix Party, or something like it, but for Spotify. Was it a very good idea? Probably not, but we wanted to start working and couldn't think of a better idea, so off we went.

By the time we started though, we realized that there already were a few iterations of the same idea on the Chrome web store, so we decided instead to build a separate website instead, where people could put on Spotify and chat with each other. This greatly increased the scope of the project, but that didn't seem important at the time.
